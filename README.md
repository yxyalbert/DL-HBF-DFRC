Deep Learning Based Hybrid Beamforming for mmWave Dual-Functional Radar-Communication

In the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) application scenario, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) based Hybrid beamforming (HBF) design for the dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system with the millimeter wave (mmWave)
massive multiple-in-multiple-output (MIMO) architecture enables real-time data exchange and environmental perception. Crucially, the numerical simulations reveal a significant reduction in bit error rate (BER), from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-7}$ at the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0 dB compared to alternative algorithms, underscoring its superiority in ensuring data integrity and reliability during transmission. This reduction in BER, alongside the 1 dB gain in sum-rate and 3 dB improvement in rad-com tradeoff beampattern, underscores the comprehensive advantages of our DL-based HBF design for DFRC systems over existing HBF designs, which provides robust support for future intelligent transportation systems.

A) For the downlink communication performance\ Through the simulation software Matlab\ Run the '4a_plotsn1.m' to get the relationship between sum rate and SNR under different methods (Fig. 4(a)) Run the '4b_ber.m' to get BER versus SNR under different methods (Fig. 4(b))\ Run the '4c_SNR_TEST.m' to get the relationship between sum rate and SNR_test under different methods (Fig. 4(c))

B) For radar beampattern performance\ Through the simulation software Matlab\ Run the '5b_readplot.m' to show that the beampattern of the proposed method is close to the best case (Fig. 5(b))\ Run '5c_test.m' shows the comparison of the beampattern of the proposed method with other methods (Fig. 5(c))

C) radar-communication tradeoff performance Through the simulation software Matlab\ Open and run the file '5a_plot_F_C_radarbeampattern.m' showing the comparison of radar performance with other methods at a trade-off factor of
0.5 (Fig. 6(a))\ Run '6b_trade.m' shows more visually the trade-off between the radar oscilloscope mean square error (MSER) and the communication sum mean square error (MSE)(Fig. 6(b))
